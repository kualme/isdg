<p>The executive committee of the International Society of Dynamic Games decided in 2003 to establish a prize to recognize the &quot;outstanding contribution to the theory and applications of dynamic games&quot; of two scholars at each of its symposium, starting in 2004.  The prize was named after Rufus Isaacs, the acknowledged founding father of differential games.</p>
